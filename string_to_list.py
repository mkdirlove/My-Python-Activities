string_words = '''United States Declaration of Independence
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The United States Declaration of Independence is the statement
adopted by the Second Continental Congress meeting at the Pennsylvania State
House (Independence Hall) in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, which announced
that the thirteen American colonies, then at war with the Kingdom of Great
Britain, regarded themselves as thirteen independent sovereign states, no longer
under British rule. These states would found a new nation â€“ the United States of
America. John Adams was a leader in pushing for independence, which was passed
on July 2 with no opposing vote cast. A committee of five had already drafted the
formal declaration, to be ready when Congress voted on independence.

John Adams persuaded the committee to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original
draft of the document, which Congress would edit to produce the final version.
The Declaration was ultimately a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July
2 to declare independence from Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of
the American Revolutionary War. The next day, Adams wrote to his wife Abigail: "The
Second Day of July 1776, will be the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America."
But Independence Day is actually celebrated on July 4, the date that the Declaration of
Independence was approved.
